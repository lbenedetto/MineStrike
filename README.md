# Mine-Strike
A vanilla, server-based Spigot plugin for Minecraft offering Counter-Strike-like functionality. Eventually, it will include multiple gamemodes, maps, weapons, and items from the latest Counter-Strike entry: Global Offensive. It is not currently playable, but is undergoing regular development.

## Motivation
People need more Counter-Strike in their lives, so Mine-Strike brings the world's most popular shooter to Minecraft in a fun, slightly minified, and easy-to-use way.

## Contributors
Main code contributors so far are only @larperdoodle, @Styyxxyx, and @spencersager, although there is a waiting group of playtesters and map-builders waiting for the go-ahead. If you plan on contributing to the project, submit a pull request, open a discussion, or send us a message.
